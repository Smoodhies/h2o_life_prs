# H2O Life — Development Log

**Status:** 🔄 Phase 12 in progress  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

---

## Phase 1 — Transparent Gap Fix

**Problem:** White/transparent checkered gap at top of hero on `localhost:3000`.

### Root Causes

1. Gradient started near-white `#e8f4fc`
2. Sky image only 55% height, no top bleed
3. Mountains/lake started at `top: 5%`
4. CSS `*` transition on `background-color` caused hydration flash
5. Container fallback `#b0d4ee` too light
6. Hero `<section>` had no fallback bg

### Fixes Applied

- [x] Gradient top color darkened
- [x] Sky layer: added top bleed, increased height
- [x] Mountains/lake: moved to top edge
- [x] Container bg updated
- [x] Hero fallback bg added
- [x] Removed `background-color` from `*` transition

---

## Phase 2 — Responsive Layer Sizing

**Problem:** Mountain perfect on mobile but too small on desktop landscape.

### Fixes Applied

- [x] Added `isPortrait` / `isUltrawide` aspect-ratio detection
- [x] Sky/mountains/lake heights adapt per aspect ratio
- [x] Rock repositions on portrait vs landscape
- [x] Leaves bleed increased to 10% all sides
- [x] Can uses `clamp(140px, 22vw, 280px)`

---

## Phase 3 — Desktop Mountain Tuning + Teal Fix

**Problem:** Mountain needed to touch top edge on desktop. Gradient had a  
teal-green cast (`#87CEEB`, `#6bbcd9`) that didn't match the natural scene.

### Fixes Applied

- [x] Mountains desktop: `top: -32%`, `width: 130%`, `height: 80%`
- [x] Removed teal-green tints from gradient
- [x] New palette: pure blue `#7CB9D6` base (no green)
- [x] Gradient: `#7CB9D6 → #8ec5de → #a3d1e8 → #8ec5de → #7CB9D6 → #5a9cb8`
- [x] Container bg: `#87CEEB` → `#7CB9D6`
- [x] Hero fallback: `#87CEEB` → `#7CB9D6`

### Current Mountain Values

| Aspect    | Top  | Width | Height |
| --------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Portrait  | -5%  | 116%  | 70%    |
| Desktop   | -32% | 130%  | 80%    |
| Ultrawide | -30% | 130%  | 100%   |

---

## Phase 4 — Entry Animations + Touch Parallax + Can Rotation (2026-02-14)

**Problem:** No entry animations, parallax only works on desktop (mouse), can rotation too slow.

### Entry Animations (GSAP timeline, buttery smooth)

- [x] **Mountains** — slide up from `y: 40%` with `opacity: 0` → position, 2.0s `power2.out`
- [x] **Lake** — fade in from `opacity: 0`, 1.8s
- [x] **Rock** — scale up from `y: 60%`, `scale: 0.8` with `back.out(1.2)` bounce, 1.6s
- [x] **Leaves** — sweep in from `y: 50%` bottom, 2.2s `power3.out`
- [x] All animations staggered for cinematic feel

### Touch Par~allax (mobile/tablet)

- [x] `touchmove` handler — maps touch position to parallax offset (reduced multipliers: 10x/6y vs 14x/8y)
- [x] `touchend` — smoothly returns all layers to center (2.0s `power3.out`)
- [x] Gyroscope (`deviceorientation`) — uses `gamma`/`beta` for tilt-based parallax on mobile
- [x] All with longer `duration` for buttery smooth feel

### Can 360 Rotation

- [x] `autoRotateSpeed` increased from `0.3` → `0.6` (smooth continuous spin)
- [x] `dampingFactor` reduced from `0.05` → `0.03` (smoother damping)

---

## Decisions

- Color: `#7CB9D6` — pure blue, no green/teal cast
- Parallax speeds: Unchanged throughout
- CSS: `background-color` removed from global `*` transitions
- Touch parallax uses reduced multipliers (10/6) vs mouse (14/8) for comfortable mobile feel
- Gyroscope parallax uses even gentler values (8/5) for subtle tilt effect

---

## Phase 5 — Rock in Front + Fixed Position (2026-02-14)

**Problem:** Rock was behind can (z:4 vs z:12), moved during parallax, and needed to be bigger.

### Fixes Applied

- [x] Rock z-index: `4` → `14` (now renders IN FRONT of can)
- [x] Can z-index: `12` → `11` (behind rock)
- [x] Rock removed from parallax layer array — no longer moves with mouse/touch/gyro
- [x] Rock removed `will-change-transform` (static element now)
- [x] Rock size increased ~8%: desktop `660px/56vw`, ultrawide `700px/48vw`, portrait `460px/85vw`
- [x] Rock + can share same `left` center point (`68%` desktop, `55%` portrait)
- [x] Both use `translateX(-50%)` for perfect center alignment
- [x] Neither moves position during parallax — fully fixed

---

## Phase 6 — Mobile Interactivity + Layout Restructure (2026-02-14)

**Problem:** 3D can not interactive on mobile — text overlay (`zIndex: 18`, full height) blocked all touch events. SHOP NOW button and scroll indicator placement needed rework.

### Mobile Touch Fix

- [x] Text overlay wrapper set to `pointer-events-none` — all touch/mouse events pass through to 3D canvas
- [x] SHOP NOW button given `pointer-events-auto` — stays clickable
- [x] On portrait, text overlay height limited to `55%` — leaves bottom half fully unblocked for can interaction

### SHOP NOW Button Relocation

- [x] Removed from hero text overlay (was inline with text content)
- [x] Moved to standalone centered position at bottom of hero
- [x] Then moved OUT of hero section entirely into `page.tsx`
- [x] Now sits in black area (`#0A0F14`) between Hero and Features sections
- [x] Styled: `py-8` padding, centered, same pill style with border + backdrop blur

### Scroll Indicator Removed

- [x] Removed "Scroll" text + gradient line at bottom of hero
- [x] Was at `bottom: 40px`, `zIndex: 20` — no longer needed

### Files Modified

- `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` — removed button + scroll indicator, added `pointer-events-none`
- `src/app/page.tsx` — added SHOP NOW button div between `<Hero />` and `<Features />`

---

## Phase 7 — Hero Text Liquid Glass Effect + Can Revert (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** Build parsing error due to missing closing div tag. Can had unnecessary 3D transforms. Text lacked premium glass effect and needed stronger inner glow.

### Build Error Fix

- [x] Fixed missing `</div>` closing tag for can container element
- [x] Atmosphere Haze and Water Darkening layers properly structured as siblings

### Can Reverted to Previous State

- [x] Removed 3D perspective transforms (`rotateY`, `rotateZ`, `rotateX`)
- [x] Centered positioning: `left: 52%` → `50%`
- [x] Removed heavy drop-shadow filter
- [x] Shadow changed back to lighter aqua-tinted glow
- [x] Material properties: roughness `0.1→0.15`, metalness `0.95→0.9`, envMapIntensity `2.0→1.5`
- [x] Removed WaterReflection component and enhanced key light
- [x] Can z-index: `12` → `10`

### H2O Text Enhancement

- [x] Added liquid glass container with minimal backdrop blur (`blur(5%)`)
- [x] Transparent background (no solid color)
- [x] Subtle frosted border (`1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`)
- [x] Removed outer text-shadow
- [x] Added powerful inner glow using `inset box-shadow`:
  - `0 0 80px rgba(102, 217, 255, 0.6)` — aqua inner glow
  - `0 0 120px rgba(0, 194, 255, 0.5)` — deeper cyan glow
  - `0 2px 4px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)` — top highlight
- [x] Enhanced gradient text fill with stronger opacity

### PURE HYDRATION Text Enhancement

- [x] Added matching liquid glass effect with 5% backdrop blur
- [x] Transparent background (removed solid background)
- [x] Minimal frosted border (`1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`)
- [x] Removed outer shadow (`drop-shadow`)
- [x] Added intense inner glow using `inset box-shadow`:
  - `0 0 60px rgba(102, 217, 255, 0.7)` — strong aqua inner glow
  - `0 0 100px rgba(0, 194, 255, 0.6)` — expansive cyan glow
  - Subtle highlight and lowlight for glass depth
- [x] Enhanced text-shadow for brighter inner lighting:
  - `0 0 40px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)` — white core glow
  - `0 0 60px rgba(102, 217, 255, 0.9)` — strong aqua halo
- [x] **Moved 5% lower:** bottom position changed from `8%/7%/6%` → `3%/2%/1%`

### Visual Effect Result

- Both text elements now feature **transparent liquid glass containers**
- **Minimal 5% blur** for subtle frosted effect without obscuring background
- **No solid backgrounds** — fully see-through with just a hint of frost
- **Powerful inner illumination** replacing outer shadows
- Text appears to **glow from within** with aqua/cyan energy
- Matching premium frosted aesthetic with the navbar
- PURE HYDRATION text positioned lower for better composition

### Files Modified

- `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` — fixed div structure, reverted can transforms, added liquid glass effects with transparent backgrounds and 5% blur
- `src/components/3d/CanModel.tsx` — reverted material properties
- `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx` — removed WaterReflection and enhanced key light
- `context.md` — updated with Phase 7 changes

---

## Phase 8 — 3D Text Enhancement + Mobile Overflow Fix (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** Text had insufficient depth and glow visibility. Text was cropping on small devices. PURE HYDRATION needed better gradient.

### 3D Text Depth & Glow Enhancement

**H2O Text:**
- [x] Enhanced gradient with stronger contrast: pure white → light cyan → deep blue progression
- [x] Increased gradient opacity from 0.85-0.9 to 0.9-0.95 for more vibrant colors
- [x] Added 8 layered depth shadows (0-8px) creating extrusion effect
- [x] Extended shadow layers to 25px with 4 blur stages for realistic 3D depth
- [x] Intensified outer glow: 60px, 90px, 130px, 170px rings at full opacity
- [x] Strengthened inner glow: 70px and 110px inset shadows at opacity 0.9-1.0
- [x] Added CSS filters: `contrast(1.15) brightness(1.1)` for enhanced visibility
- [x] Drop-shadow increased to 50px blur with 0.7 opacity

**PURE HYDRATION Text:**
- [x] **New gradient applied**: Top-to-bottom white → light cyan → medium blue progression
  - `rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)` pure white at top
  - `rgba(240, 250, 255, 0.98)` very light cyan
  - `rgba(200, 240, 255, 0.95)` light blue middle
  - `rgba(150, 220, 255, 0.92)` medium cyan
  - `rgba(100, 200, 240, 0.9)` deeper blue at bottom
- [x] Applied gradient as text fill using `background-clip: text`
- [x] Added 8 layered depth shadows (0-8px) for 3D extrusion
- [x] Extended shadow layers to 22px with 4 blur stages
- [x] Intensified outer glow: 50px, 70px, 100px, 140px rings at full opacity
- [x] Strengthened inner glow: 60px and 90px inset shadows at opacity 0.9-1.0
- [x] Added CSS filters: `contrast(1.2) brightness(1.15)` for maximum pop
- [x] Drop-shadow increased to 30px blur with 0.6 opacity

### Mobile Overflow & Cropping Fix

- [x] H2O text: Added `maxWidth: "100vw"`, `overflow: "visible"`, `whiteSpace: "nowrap"`
- [x] PURE HYDRATION container: Increased width from `90%` to `95%` for more breathing room
- [x] PURE HYDRATION text: Added `overflow: "visible"`, `whiteSpace: "normal"`, `wordWrap: "break-word"`
- [x] Added `maxWidth: "100%"` to text element for responsive wrapping
- [x] Text now properly scales and wraps on all device sizes without cropping

### Visual Improvements Summary

- **Higher contrast**: Brighter whites, more vibrant cyans, deeper blues
- **More visible 3D depth**: 8 stacked layers creating clear extrusion
- **Stronger glow**: Full opacity outer halos (60-170px range)
- **Enhanced inner lighting**: Brighter inset glows for "light from within" effect
- **Better readability**: Contrast and brightness filters make text pop
- **No mobile cropping**: Proper overflow handling and responsive sizing
- **Premium appearance**: Text looks dimensional, luminous, and professional

### Files Modified

- `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` — enhanced gradients, added 3D shadows, fixed mobile overflow
- `context.md` — updated with Phase 8 changes

---

## Phase 9 — Loading Animation System (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** 3D model loading caused blank screen and laggy first impression. Need smooth loading experience.

### Loading System Architecture

**Full-Page Loader (PageLoader.tsx):**
- [x] Created new `PageLoader.tsx` component with H2O logo
- [x] Animated logo fade-in and scale-in on mount
- [x] Three-dot loading indicator with staggered pulse animation
- [x] Minimum 800ms display time before fade out
- [x] Smooth opacity transition when loading completes
- [x] Integrated into root `layout.tsx` for app-wide coverage

**3D Scene PNG Placeholder System:**
- [x] Added PNG can image placeholder in `Scene.tsx`
- [x] State management: `is3DReady`, `showPlaceholder` for transition control
- [x] `handle3DLoad` callback with 300ms delay before hiding placeholder
- [x] Canvas `onCreated` hook triggers load detection
- [x] Smooth crossfade: PNG opacity 1→0 as 3D opacity 0→1
- [x] PNG matches exact position/size of 3D can for seamless transition
- [x] Fallback to PNG if 3D fails to load (graceful degradation)

**Hero Animation Enhancement:**
- [x] Added `h2oTextRef` for direct GSAP animation control
- [x] Improved animation timeline with staggered entry sequence
- [x] Timeline sequence: H2O text (500ms) → 3D can (600ms) → PURE HYDRATION (700ms)
- [x] H2O text uses `back.out` easing for subtle overshoot bounce
- [x] Can transforms use `power2.out` for smooth deceleration
- [x] Overlapping timings create fluid cascading entry effect
- [x] All animations reduced to 0.8s duration for snappier feel

**Animation Keyframes (globals.css):**
- [x] `fadeIn` — 0→1 opacity over 600ms
- [x] `slideUp` — translate from 20px below with fade
- [x] `scaleIn` — scale from 0.9 with fade over 500ms
- [x] `subtleFloat` — gentle 10px vertical float loop (3s)
- [x] `shimmerLoad` — left-to-right shine effect for loading states

### Loading Experience Flow

1. **Initial Load (0-800ms):** PageLoader displays with animated H2O logo
2. **Scene Load (800ms+):** PNG can placeholder visible, smooth fade-in
3. **3D Ready (varies):** 3D model loads in background
4. **Crossfade (300ms):** PNG fades out as 3D fades in seamlessly
5. **Hero Animation (1.5s):** Staggered text and can entry animations

### Performance Benefits

- **Perceived Performance:** PNG loads instantly vs 3D model delay
- **Visual Continuity:** Placeholder maintains layout, no content shift
- **Reduced Jank:** 3D rendering happens off-screen during fade
- **Graceful Degradation:** PNG fallback if 3D fails
- **Professional UX:** Smooth transitions eliminate blank states

### Files Modified

- `src/components/PageLoader.tsx` — NEW FILE — full-page loading component
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — integrated PageLoader component
- `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx` — added PNG placeholder with crossfade system
- `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` — enhanced GSAP animations with h2oTextRef
- `src/app/globals.css` — added loading animation keyframes
- `context.md` — updated with Phase 9 changes

**Status:** ✅ Loading system complete and functional

---

## Phase 10 — Dark Mode Can Textures + Theme Toggle (2026-02-19)

**Problem:** 3D can had no dark mode awareness. Needed dark textures applied when dark mode is on, with smooth animated transition.

### Dark Mode Texture System (CanModel.tsx)

- [x] Added `theme` prop to `CanModel` component (`"light" | "dark"`)
- [x] Loads **both** texture sets simultaneously:
  - Light: `/textures/front.png`, `/textures/back.png`
  - Dark: `/img/dark_can/dark_front.png`, `/img/dark_can/dark_back.png`
- [x] Swaps `frontTexture`/`backTexture` based on theme
- [x] Combined canvas texture rebuilt automatically on theme change
- [x] Neck/rim/ring colors adapt per theme:
  - Dark: `#2a2a2a` neck, `#1a1a1a` rim, `#222222` ring
  - Light: `#dadada` neck, `#ffffff` rim, `#c5c5c5` ring

### 360° Y-Axis Spin Animation

- [x] On theme toggle: buttery smooth 360° Y-axis rotation (front → back → front)
- [x] Duration: 1.2 seconds for full rotation
- [x] Cubic ease-in-out easing for premium feel
- [x] Starts from default `-0.3` Y rotation, completes full circle back to start
- [x] Uses `useFrame` delta for frame-rate-independent animation
- [x] `prevTheme` ref prevents re-triggering on re-renders

### Theme-Aware PNG Placeholder (Scene.tsx)

- [x] Scene imports `useTheme()` from ThemeContext
- [x] Placeholder image switches per theme:
  - Dark: `/hero_prd/black_front_can.png`
  - Light: `/hero_prd/white_front_can.png`
- [x] Both initial load and 3D loading states use themed placeholder
- [x] Theme passed to `<CanModel theme={theme} />` for real-time switching

### PageLoader Cleanup

- [x] Removed H2O text, loading dots, "LOADING EXPERIENCE" text
- [x] Now shows only clean gradient background that fades out
- [x] Removed `Image` import (no longer needed)

### Files Modified

- `src/components/3d/CanModel.tsx` — dark mode textures, Y-axis spin, theme-aware colors
- `src/components/3d/Scene.tsx` — theme-aware placeholder, passes theme to CanModel
- `src/components/ui/PageLoader.tsx` — stripped to minimal gradient loader
- `context.md` — updated with Phase 10 changes

**Status:** ✅ Dark mode can system complete

---

## Phase 11 — Product Showcase Section Fixes (2026-02-19)

**Problem:** "NOT JUST WATER" text not visible in light mode, overlaying behind product cards, missing gaps in section, unnecessary descriptive paragraph.

### Text Visibility Enhancement

- [x] Changed light mode heading color from `#0a0f14` → `#000000` (pure black)
- [x] Enhanced light mode shadow: `0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15), 0 0 30px rgba(0, 160, 255, 0.2)`
- [x] Increased font-weight to 900 (extra bold) for better contrast
- [x] Maintains dark mode styling: white text with aqua glow

### Z-Index Overlay Fix

- [x] Added `relative z-20` to "NOT JUST WATER" section container
- [x] Ensures heading and mini feature cards render above product cards
- [x] Eliminates visual stacking issues where text appeared behind cards

### Section Spacing Improvements

- [x] Added responsive padding to mini feature cards container:
  - Mobile: `px-4` (16px)
  - Medium: `px-8` (32px)  
  - Large: `px-12` (48px)
- [x] Better horizontal breathing room at all breakpoints

### Content Cleanup

- [x] Removed unnecessary paragraph: "Premium water crafted from glacial springs, enhanced with essential minerals. Experience hydration the way nature intended — pure, crisp, extraordinary."
- [x] Streamlined hero text section for cleaner, more focused design
- [x] Reduced content density while maintaining clear hierarchy

### Visual Result

- **Light Mode:** Pure black heading with subtle shadow and aqua glow stands out clearly against light gradient background
- **Dark Mode:** White heading with strong aqua glow maintains premium aesthetic
- **Z-Index:** All text properly layered above product cards throughout scroll
- **Spacing:** Enhanced gaps create better visual rhythm and card separation

### Files Modified

- `src/components/sections/ProductShowcase.tsx` — text visibility, z-index fix, spacing, content removal
- `context.md` — updated with Phase 11 changes

**Status:** ✅ Product Showcase section fixes complete

---

## Phase 12 — Studio Navbar + Hero Integration

**Status:** 🔄 In progress  
**Date:** 2026-02-20

**Goal:** Replace the existing `HeroNavbar` (SVG liquid distortion pill) and `Hero` (3D/GSAP/parallax) with the Studio equivalents — a liquid glass pill navbar with functional cart sidebar, and a lightweight CSS-only hero featuring a can PNG and floating ice cubes. All other sections (ProductShowcase, Features, 3D scene) remain completely untouched.

**Why:** The Studio versions deliver a richer above-the-fold visual (glass shimmer pill, aqua glow can) with zero Three.js overhead in the first paint zone, leading to faster TTI. The cart sidebar adds real e-commerce utility that was missing.

- [ ] Visual verification in browser
- [ ] TypeScript check (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Studio Navbar renders as floating glass pill, shimmer/blur on scroll
- [ ] Theme toggle updates both `data-theme` (PRS components) and `dark:` class (Studio components)
- [ ] Cart icon shows badge count; opens CartSidebar slide-in panel
- [ ] Cart: add/remove items, qty +/−, subtotal calculates correctly
- [ ] "Shop Now" scrolls to `#product-showcase` section
- [ ] Mobile: hamburger opens/closes Studio nav overlay
- [ ] ProductShowcase + Features sections render and animate as before
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No hydration mismatch errors in console

### Decisions

- **Cart:** Functional (add, qty, remove, subtotal) — no checkout/payment, matches Studio scope
- **Dark mode:** Dual-write strategy keeps both component systems in sync without refactoring PRS globals
- **Can image:** External ibb.co URL via plain `<img>` (no `next/image` domain config needed)
- **Logo:** Reuses existing `/logos/h2o_logo.png` via `next/image` in `StudioNavbar`
- **Old Hero/Navbar:** Kept as backup — not deleted
- **Routing:** Studio SPA `onNavigate` replaced with anchor `href` scroll — no new pages added
- **Animations:** Studio keyframes (`shimmer`, `pulse-glow`, `float`) added to `tailwind.config.js` to stay consistent with how PRS manages custom animations
