## Why Can't I Auto-Download?

Video hosting sites (Pexels, Mixkit, etc.) block automated downloads to prevent abuse. Manual download takes just 30 seconds! 🚀

## What Happens Without a Video?

The site still works perfectly! You'll just see:
- ✅ Your 3D can with textures
- ✅ Floating water particles
- ✅ Premium UI design
- ❌ No video background (just transparent)

Add the video whenever you're ready for the full immersive effect!
